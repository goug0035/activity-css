    <p>Since I was young I have always had a love for swimming and sports and around the age of 12, I began to play water polo with small clubs and groups. As I got older and started to play at the competitive levels I realized that a lot of my friends had no idea what water polo was. Here are some of the facts and rules to the game.</p>
    
    <h2>History of the Game</h2>

    <p>The history of water polo as a team sport began as a demonstration of strength and swimming skill in late 19th century England and Scotland. The rules of water polo were originally developed by William Wilson. The first games of aquatic football were played with a ball constructed of India rubber. This game came to be called "water polo" based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, pulu. Early play allowed brute strength, wrestling and holding opposing players underwater to recover the ball; the goalie stood outside the playing area and defended the goal by jumping in on any opponent attempting to score by placing the ball on the deck. Men's water polo was among the first team sports introduced at the modern Olympic games in 1900. Water polo is now popular in many countries around the world, notably Europe (particularly in Serbia, Russia, Croatia, Italy, Montenegro, Greece and Hungary), the United States, Canada and Australia. The goal of the game being to score the most goal.</p>

    <p>Water polo is a contact sport, with little protective gear besides swim suits and caps with ear protectors. Above the water and below the water are 2 different world. players have leaned to be sneaky with the ways they sink, hold, and kick opponents. Things such as use their body weight leaning on opponents back to sink them or grabbing their swimsuits underwater. If the ref cant see he cant call it. So on top of the immense amount of endurance required for the game, you have to able to take a few kick to the stomach.</p>
